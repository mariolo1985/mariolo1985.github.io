### SCOPE 

Styleguide dev pages

### PURPOSE 

To determine if we are missing any information a developer will need and if the information is arranged in an order of importance.

### DISCUSSION

Hi, I am [NAME] and I am conducting a study on styleguides. I am trying to determine if we are presenting enough information to someone to use our styleguide.

- What is a development framework you enjoy using currently?

- What you were you doing the last time you used a styleguide? 

- Where were you?

- What did you look for?
    - What did you use from the styleguide?

- Think back to when you used a styleguide that you enjoyed. 
    - What did you enjoy about using this styleguide?
    - What were you doing?

    - What were you looking for?
